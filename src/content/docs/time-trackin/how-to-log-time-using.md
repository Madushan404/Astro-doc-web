In Worklenz, you can track your time in two main types. This is important for measuring our task time and predicting the entire project time. So first, you should click the **Create task** button or **Open** Option in the task list. It will open the Create task drawer, and you can see the Time Log section at the top of it.

After Clicking the Time Log section, you can see the timer on the left side near the **Export** button. If you click that timer, it will start, and after clicking it, you can stop it. Your time will be automatically recorded in the Time Log list.

You can set a time log for your task freshly crating time or previously created one.
