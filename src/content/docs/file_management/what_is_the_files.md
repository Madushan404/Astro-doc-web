Description: A guide on my new Starlight docs site.

Worklenz File feature is a showcase of all tasks in your project. You can see details in the files separately.

### What we can do?

Inside the File section, you can see all the attached files relevant to the tasks. In there, you can identify file names, Attached tasks, file size, uploaded members, and uploaded time.

Also if you want to delete the attached file using the **Delete** button and using the **Download** button you can download any task relevant to all tasks.
