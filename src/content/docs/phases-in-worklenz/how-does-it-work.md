In order to manage processes well in our application, we have to add several phases to all tasks according to their type. When creating a task, we can set the relevant phase for it.

After inside the project, you have to clearly identify tasks according to their phases.

- We have to easily group our all tasks according to their phases.
- You can select all tasks short by the phase, using the **Group By** dropdown list.
