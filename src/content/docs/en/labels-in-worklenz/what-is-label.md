Labels are keywords or tags that you can assign to work items in order to categorize and differentiate them within your project. They are ideal for tracking components or other unique identifiers that donâ€™t fall under the standard work item properties.

Labels can be used to group work items by common attributes, such as type, feature, or any other custom classification. They make it easier to filter in task list and find related work items across your project.
