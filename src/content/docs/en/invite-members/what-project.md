A project invitation is a formal request sent to a person to join a project as a collaborator or team member within a Worklenz. The invitation allows the invited person to access the projectâ€™s workspace, collaborate with other members, and perform assigned tasks.

### How to do it?

- First, you should gain insight into your project.

- Then click the "invite" button on the top corner of the project interface.
