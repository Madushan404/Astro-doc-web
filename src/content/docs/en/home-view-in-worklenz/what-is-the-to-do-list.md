On the home page, you can see a main section as the "to-do list". You can customize this list as it is. In the To Do list, you can see a text box for entering your task. After entering a task, press the **Enter** button to add a new task to the list.

<p align ="center">
<img src="/To_Do_list.png" style="border: 2px solid #D4d4d4; border-radius: 8px; Â ">
</p>

All tasks will create the correct icon mark. If you click this correct icon, that task will be marked as complete, and it will disappear from the To Do List. Also, you can refresh your To Do List by pressing the Refresh icon.

This list is very important for managing your day-to-day tasks properly and it is easy to handle.
