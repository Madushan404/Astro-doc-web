On the Home page, we can see the main Two Views as, List View and Calander View. So in the Calander view, you can see the arrangement of your tasks within the month. It is an easy view to identify working days and free days. Also, that view is easier to handle and manage than the list view.

In that calendar view, you can see another task list, and if you click any date that task list shows how many works have that day and what are they. Also, at the top of the calendar, you have a date picker, it is easy to select any month or year you want to. Also, you can switch the calendar view to month and year.
