On the home page, we have to see other options such as "Assign to me" and "Assign by me". Using that option you can filter your entire task according to assign to me and assign by me state. This option is located at the top of the task list. Clicking the Task dropdown you can select the wanted option also according to your selected option task list will filter and rearrange. If you are the owner of any project and you assign any task for your member, that task will come in the "Assign by me "category and if any owner assigns a task for you to do, that type of task will come as the "Assign to me" category.
