You can see Time reports,

- As a Project
- As a Member
- As an Estimated vs Actual

The worklenz gives you a separate section for the reporting. But this section is only accessible to the admin or project owner. Using this section you can export several reports about your team and projects.

So if you want to export the Time report, you should go to the **Reporting** page in the worklenz.

</p>

On the Reporting page, you can see the **Time Reports** navigation. If you click the Time Reporting navigation you can see a time report created based on several things(Members, Project, Estimated vs Actual). Using the **Export** button you can export your report as a document. also near the Export button, you can select reporting time as how many days, and using the **Include Archived Project** check box you can add Archive project also your report.
