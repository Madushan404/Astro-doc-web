In Worklenz, you can track your time in two main types. This is important for measuring our task time and predicting the entire project time. So first, you should click the **Create task** button or **Open** Option in the task list. It will open the Create task drawer, and you can see the Time Log section at the top of it.

After Clicking the Time Log section, you can see the **Add Timelog** button. Using that button you can set a time log for already done tasks. Firstly you should click that button and after it opens, you can see the Date, Start time, End time, and work description box. You can fill it out and click the **Log Time** button to easily add a time log to your list.

You can set a time log for your task freshly crating time or previously created one.
