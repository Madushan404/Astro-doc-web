Workload is the entire set of tasks, processes, and computational demands required to facilitate project planning, execution, monitoring, and collaboration. It includes resource allocation, task scheduling, progress tracking, and communication functionalities to ensure efficient project execution.

The workload includes:

- Task and project management: Creating, assigning, and tracking tasks.
- Resource allocation: Distributing the workload among team members.
- Collaboration and communication: Enabling group discussions, ideas, and file sharing.
- Reporting and analytics: Providing insight into project progress and workload distribution.
- Automation and workflow management: Automating repetitive tasks and optimizing workflows.

In the Worklenz **workload** feature you have to get a summary of all members, tasks, and duties. Using the given calendar you can easily identify all members and how to divide among tasks and how to divide among the month or year with their tasks.

Also, you can see each member's progress clearly by using graphs. And you can filter each member task with several conditions.
