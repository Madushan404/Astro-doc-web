Task archiving in Worklenz is the process of storing completed or inactive tasks in a separate archive while retaining essential task data. Instead of permanently deleting tasks, archiving ensures that past work remains accessible for reference without cluttering active task lists.

Benefits of Archiving Tasks in Worklenz,

- Improved Organization – Helps keep the workspace clean by removing inactive or completed tasks from the active task list.
- Easy Retrieval – Archived tasks can be accessed later for audits, reviews, or reactivation.
- Better Performance – Reduces the number of active tasks displayed, leading to improved system performance.
- Historical Reference – Maintains records of completed tasks, allowing project managers to track progress and review past decisions.
- Security & Compliance – Ensures that important work history is retained for legal or operational purposes.
- Collaboration Efficiency – Prevents confusion by separating ongoing tasks from completed ones.
