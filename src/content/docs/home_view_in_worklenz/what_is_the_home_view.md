Worklenz home page is a dynamic page customized according to your profile. So when you go to this page you can see your name and your all assigned data will be. The Home page is the simple Dashboard of our work schedule.

In the Dashboard, we can see the main three Tables

- Task List
- To-Do List
- Project List

Also, we can see the main two moods on our Home page such as ListView and Calander View. In the List view, you can see the arrangement of your task as a several list. But with the calendar view, you can see your task how to divide within the days, and how to schedule your month.

Also, the Home page gives a to chance create a new project. If you create a new project you become an owner of that project and you can add more tasks to the Task list and To Do list.
